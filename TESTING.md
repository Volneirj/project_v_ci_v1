### CSS

- Using the [W3C CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/), the CSS code was checked for errors using the direct input option.

### Python

- Using the [CI Python Linter - Code Institute](https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com/), the Python code was inspected and validated. All `.py` files were checked, and most issues found were related to missing or extra blank lines and long lines. All issues were fixed.

## Responsiveness and Device Testing

Throughout the development process, the website was rigorously tested across a range of devices, including desktops, laptops, smartphones, and tablets. This testing ensured that the website displayed correctly on screens of various sizes and orientations, both portrait and landscape. Additionally, the responsive design was validated using Google Chrome's developer tools to confirm that the layout remained structurally sound and adaptable across different screen dimensions. No issues were noted, affirming that the site functions as expected across diverse environments.

## Browser Testing

The website was tested across Google Chrome, Safari, and Microsoft Edge, and no issues were found.

## Manual and Automated Testing

To ensure thorough testing, organization, and control throughout the development process, all testing activities were meticulously aligned with the requirements and acceptance criteria outlined in the epic and related user stories. This structured approach allowed us to systematically cover every aspect of the application, ensuring comprehensive test coverage and alignment with project goals.

### Automated Testing

To achieve a robust and reliable application, a comprehensive testing strategy was implemented, combining both manual and automated methods. Leveraging Django's built-in testing framework, automated tests were meticulously developed to cover critical functionalities, including views and forms.

Each test was directly tied to specific user stories, ensuring that the application not only met technical requirements but also aligned with user needs and expectations. This approach provided thorough coverage, verifying that the application behaves as expected under various scenarios and that all features deliver the intended user experience.

To run the tests, I executed the following command in the terminal:

`python3 manage.py test`

Total Count of Automated Tests: 41

To create the coverage report, I ran the following commands:

`coverage run --source=name-of-app manage.py test`

`coverage report`

Below are the reports on automated tests.

### Manual Testing

A comprehensive manual testing process was conducted to address areas that automated tests could not cover. Every test has been documented in the user stories below, where they are meticulously organized by application and test type to ensure complete coverage and clarity.

### Bugs and Errors

Two issues were identified during testing: one related to time zone handling in the model and another concerning HTML form validation on the sign-up page. The first bug involved a conflict when calculating the return date due to time zone differences, which has been successfully resolved. The second issue, stemming from Crispy Forms, affected form validation. 

The resolution for the time zone bug is detailed in the stories below.

Regarding the HTML validation error, I have chosen to leave it as is since it does not impact the application's functionality and is caused by Crispy Forms. Below, you can see the error encountered during validation testing with the [W3C HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org/). The second image highlights the specific line where the error occurs, identified through page inspection.
