## Project Overview

### Purpose:

This project serves as an educational resource, demonstrating the application of Python development skills in building a comprehensive, fully functional e-commerce platform. The project showcases how **Django** can be leveraged to create a scalable, interactive, and secure application, with a focus on user experience, data management, and thorough testing. 

The system includes features such as:
- **Stripe Payments** for secure and reliable online transactions.
- A robust e-commerce platform supporting product browsing, filtering, and detailed product views.
- **AWS S3** for scalable and reliable storage of media and static files.
- A responsive and visually appealing design using **Bootstrap**.

This project exemplifies how **Python**, **Django**, **Bootstrap**, **Stripe**, and **AWS** can be combined to build a fully functional, secure, and visually appealing web application, taking into account real-world considerations like payment integration, scalability, and performance.

## Technical Design

### WireFrames

- When the VIL-MASYS project began, I created basic wireframes to outline the initial design and functionality of the application. These wireframes served as a starting point to visualize the core structure and user flow. However, as development progressed, significant changes were made to improve the user experience, functionality, and overall design.

- Initial WireFrame Design:
        <details><summary>Home</summary><img src="documentation/readme_images/wireframes/home.jpg"></details>
        <details><summary>Book Info</summary><img src="documentation/readme_images/wireframes/book-info.jpg"></details>
        <details><summary>Login</summary><img src="documentation/readme_images/wireframes/login.jpg"></details>
        <details><summary>Issued Book</summary><img src="documentation/readme_images/wireframes/issue-book-page.jpg"></details>
        <details><summary>About</summary><img src="documentation/readme_images/wireframes/about.jpg"></details>

- Key Changes:
    - Enhanced User Interface: The initial wireframes were simple and lacked the visual appeal needed for a modern web application. As the project evolved, I introduced a more polished and intuitive interface, incorporating feedback and best practices in UI/UX design.

    - Expanded Features: Originally, the wireframes focused on basic functionalities. During development, new features were added, such as personalized book recommendations, late fees, notifications, and advanced search capabilities, which were not part of the initial plan.

    - Improved Navigation and Layout: The initial wireframes had a straightforward but somewhat limited navigation structure. I restructured the layout to provide a more seamless and logical flow, making it easier for users to navigate between different sections of the application.

### Models Relationships

- Key Relationships:
    1. Book and IssuedBook Relationship
        - Relationship Type: One-to-Many (ForeignKey)
            Explanation:
            - The Book model represents each book in the library's collection.
            - The IssuedBook model keeps track of each instance where a book is issued to a user.
            - A single Book can be issued multiple times, hence the one-to-many relationship. This is implemented using a ForeignKey in the IssuedBook model that references the Book model.
            - The related_name='issued_books' allows you to access all issued records for a particular book using book.issued_books.all().
    2. User and IssuedBook Relationship
        - Relationship Type: One-to-Many (ForeignKey)
            Explanation:
            - The User model (from Django’s built-in authentication system) represents the users of the library system.
            - Each user can issue multiple books over time. Therefore, there is a one-to-many relationship between User and IssuedBook.
            - The ForeignKey in the IssuedBook model links each issued book to the specific user who has borrowed it.
            - The related_name='issued_books' allows you to retrieve all the books issued by a particular user using user.issued_books.all().
    3. BookSuggestion Model
    - Standalone Entity:
            - The BookSuggestion model is independent of the Book and IssuedBook models. It captures suggestions for new books that users want to see in the library.
            - This model contains information about the suggested book's title and author, as well as optional fields for the user’s name, email, and reason for suggesting the book.
            - While this model is not directly related to the Book or User models through foreign keys, it plays an important role in allowing users to contribute to the library’s growth.
